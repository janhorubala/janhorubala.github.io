Playing music on a house parties is a serious problem and there are two major scenario. First, when one person (let's call him a dominator) play music he wants and everyone else are too scared or drunk to oppose. Second, more like in democratic countries, when everybody fighting for an access to the laptop.


In this part of program we would focus on the second case. In Poland we call this violence-parties a youtube parties and it’s really huge problem for society, especially for young, poor people. Situations like this leaded to brought relationships, fightings, crimes, destroyed properties etc.


How to deal with this sociological issue? After many researches and participatory observation we created mixtube.co - a special tool to canalise peoples creativity and aggression for make a perfect playlist for party. How it works? That’s so easy even completely drunk party-cipant can deal with it.


First you create a new playlist (name it as you want - you don’t need any registration or sign up). That would generate a special link, which you send to all of your friends. Every person who gets the link, can add and vote for a songs on a playlist (from their computers, phones, tablets, smartphones, etc.).


Computer on which you create a playlist has a admin privileges, which means you can remove any song, skip and of course operate the player. Platform was created by special designer and UX and tested by crowds of drunk students to be sure that it’s understandable and party-proof.
