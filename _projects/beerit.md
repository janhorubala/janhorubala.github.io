# BeerIt

When I was ending my adventure with academic education on Computer Science Faculty, I had a chance with my team to choose a topic of our thesis. That’s why we ended up with a mobile application for beer-lovers. To be more serious, there are vast of local beers, here in Poland. You can go to brewery competitions, huge festivals for beer enthusiasts and even attend a tour the beer trail. However, there’s no good source of information about local, unknown beers.

To graduate it’s not enough to write simple CRUD app (of course it is), so we have to add some ultra-mega-feature to made it more scientific. We decided to create a neural network that would recognize beer based on a photo of beer bottle. That’s right! You take a of photo of beer you're drinking and immediately you get detailed information about IBU, EBC, recommended serving temperature and so on…

Additionally we created **cellar** and **wishlist** - places where you can store sampled or desirable beers. For users' convenience we created manual search (in case you don't have the beer at hand) and very long and constantly updated lists with the newest, most popular and recommended beers. But how do we get informations about rare, new beers? No problem! We created an admin panel for breweries to manage information about its beers.

This is how I graduated (with evaluation of 5), if you are curious about technical details of our work you can checkout the [thesis]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/thesis_informatics.pdf). But if you prefer more mundane entertainment, you can download our app (for Android and IOS) and look for some [new beers](https://beerit.co/). In this project I was mainly responsible for develop IOS app, I started with Swift 2 but then I discovered React Native and rewrite all app with pleasure.
