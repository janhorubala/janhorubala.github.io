How to move from Intermediate to Advanced in language proficiency? Below I described four simple rules that helps me to improve my language skills. Plus few helpful resources.

#### 1. Vocabulary - 30 min/day

To learn new vocabulary you can use [Anki App](https://www.ankiapp.com/) - application with [Spaced Repetition System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition). When you add a new word, add information about part of speech and usage (simple example that gives you a context). For example:

	guffaw [verb] both men guffawed at the remark
	uptight [adjective] don't get so uptight about everything

#### 2. Writing - 30 min/day

Every day, once a day, write a short article about some actual stuff, you're doing (I keep a list of ready topics, not to lose time). Find a person that would check your mistakes or publish your posts at [italki.com](https://www.italki.com), where some volunteers would check out your works.

#### 3. Speaking - 30 min/day

Use [italki.com](https://www.italki.com) or [speaking24.com](http://speaking24.com/) to find a language partner. You can find a native speaker that wants to learn you langauge or you can buy lessons with professionall teachers or community tutors (only on italki). It's really important to find a speaker that's better than you - in other way you wouldn't make any progress. Another portal for language partners is [myhappyplanet.com](http://www.myhappyplanet.com/index.php) but I never used them.

#### 4. Grammar - 3 times/week

Find your favorite way of learning grammar. You can do it with a teacher (if you don't have enough motivation), you can jump straight into the deep end and start just reading [Grammar in Use for Advanced](http://www.slideshare.net/Marinalandia/advanced-grammar-in-use-3rd-edition). Or you can try some tips and tricks from the Internet, like grammar deconstruction or learning grammar with [Benny Lewis](http://www.fluentin3months.com/grammar/)
