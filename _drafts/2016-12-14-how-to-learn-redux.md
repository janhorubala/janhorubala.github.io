List of Redux tutorials in learning order. Additionally short describtion about difference in React and Redux that could helps you to understand Redux approach and learn faster.

I've developed few React apps and I faced repeated issue. In React architecture you can pass data only in one way - from parents to childs (or - with events - from childs to parents). This approach have a great advantages. React can optimaze rendering in a great way, and you can focus on simply breaking you app to componentns and implement every component independently (which is a great facilitation). Many programmers praise this [declarative paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) coming with React.

But as soon as the data flow is one-way you can't pass data between not-releated components. I had this problem especially in mobile apps, when I had several tabs, user updates some information in one tab and I have to update data in other tabs too. And here comes Redux. But Redux is not a next magic framework, that can fixed all your problem with `npm install` command. Redux is different then React. To learn Redux you have forget a little about React approach.
